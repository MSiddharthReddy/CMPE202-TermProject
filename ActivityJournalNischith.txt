The project that was initially planned for development was to be developed from scratch hence observing the complexity the team decided to incorporate design patterns to an alrady existing application.

Going through a few few existing application I suggested on implementing Flappybird game. The team decided to go through the application and see if different design patterns caould be incorporated into the game. I went through the tutorials and foundout Command pattern and Composite pattern could be incorporated into the game.
